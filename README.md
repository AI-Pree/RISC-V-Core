# RISC-V-Core
- RISC-V core for FPGA (Decided to run test for now, instead of directly running in the physical hardware or run it on hardware simulator)
- Uses Harvard Computer architecture (might add  Von neumann arch later)


# Planned for later
- Add the pipeline process for the Instruction (for now I'm just gonna execute the intruction in sequential order)
